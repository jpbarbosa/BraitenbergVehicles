The object class implements some basic  services that all classes will have access to. <p> Subclassing Object directly is rare.  The classes OBJECT(Real) and  OBJECT(Abstract) are logical separations of the Object class containing  "real" objects (which correspond to a physical entity in the simulated  world) and "abstract" objects which are generally used for computation  or control of the real objects.  You should consider subclassing   one of these classes instead.'''

This means that you should make dependencies sparingly, only when absolutely required. <p> Circular dependencies are forbidden.'''

This method is used in circumstances where you might want to have some sort of callback method.  As an example, let's  say you write a general purpose class which can sort objects based  on different criteria.  How would the user specify these arbitrary criteria?  Using this method would allow the user to pass in the name of the method they want to use, and the sorting object could use this method to execute the callback. <p> If the concept of a callback doesn't make sense, then you can probably ignore this method.'''
