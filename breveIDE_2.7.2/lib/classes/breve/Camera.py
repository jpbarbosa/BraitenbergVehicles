	'''Summary: creates a new rendering perspective in the simulated world. <P> The Camera class is used to set up a viewing perspective in a simulation. Creating a new camera object places a viewing area with the new camera  perspective in the main viewing window. <P> See the OBJECT(Image) class to read data from a Camera (or from the  main simulation window) into a pixel buffer.  This can be useful for implementing vision algorithms.'''
