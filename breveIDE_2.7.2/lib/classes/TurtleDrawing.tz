Drawing : TurtleDrawing {
	% The TurtleDrawing class is a subclass of OBJECT(Drawing) which allows 
	% drawing via a series of "logo turtle"-like commands.  Drawing is 
	% accomplished by giving commands to a turtle moving around in 3D space.
	% All commands are interpreted from the turtle's perspective, taking into
	% account its current position and orientation.
	% <P>
	% Unlike other angles used by breve, this class refers to angles as degrees
	% and not radians to more closely match the behavior of traditional Logo 
	% implementations.
