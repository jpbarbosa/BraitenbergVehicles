Abstract : Data (aka Datum) [version 2.0] {
	% <b>The use of this class is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.</b>.
	% See the section

	% The now obsolete class description follows.
	% <p>
    % The Data class is a special class that can be saved to disk, loaded in 
    % to simulations and otherwise manipulated in ways that other classes 
    % cannot.  Because of the features of this class, it may only contain 
    % variables of type int, float or vector.
    % <p>
	% Previous versions of breve used a binary format for saving and loading
	% data objects--the current version saves as XML files.  A method for 
	% loading binary objects from previous versions still exists METHOD(load-from-file), 
	% but its use is deprecated.

    + to save-with-dialog:

        % filename, and then saves the contents of this instance to

        % Presents the user with a save dialog box in order to get a 
        % filename, and then loads the contents of the specified filename
        % into this instance.  The chosen file must contain a previously
        % saved instance of the same object.
