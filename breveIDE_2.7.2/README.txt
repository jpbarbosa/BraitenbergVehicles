                      The breve Simulation Environment

                      http://www.spiderland.org/breve
                        release 2.7.2 - 02-24-08
             command line version for Mac OS X, Linux and Windows
                         jk [at] spiderland.org 

                           -= INTRODUCTION =-

breve is a simulation environment which allows users to define the behaviors 
and interactions of different types of agents in a simulated 3D world and 
observe the emergent behaviors.  breve is conceptually similar to packages 
such as Swarm and StarLogo, but simulates objects in a continuous 3D world 
with continuous time.  breve thus allows simulation involving realistic 
collision detection and physics.   

Agent behaviors are written in Python or in a simple scripting language called
"steve".  Users can define an agent's behavior by specifying how the agent 
interacts with the world at each timestep and how the agent reacts to events 
like collisions.

breve includes full collision detection and physical simulation of rigid 
bodies.  See the Walker and Gravity demo simulations for examples.   

For more detailed information about the breve environment, consult the 
documentation in the "docs" directory.

                             -= GETTING STARTED =- 

NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS: You'll need to download the GLUT library in order
to run breve.  One source for this is: 
http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html

The best way to get started with breve is to run some of the included demo 
simulations, which are found in the "demos" directory.  More complete 
information on programming and running simulations with breve is available 
in the documentation, which is found in the "docs" directory.

These are the directions to get started quickly with the command-line 
version of breve 2.4.

1) set the environment variable BREVE_CLASS_PATH to the full path of the
   included "lib/classes" directory.  For example, using the bash shell
   under Linux or Mac OS X:

       export BREVE_CLASS_PATH=<path to breve>/lib/classes

   Under windows, this might be something like:

       set BREVE_CLASS_PATH=C:\<path to breve>\lib\classes

2) run breve with one of the demo files: breve <simulation file>.
   For example:

       ./bin/breve ./demos/Gatherers.tz

   Or under Windows:

        \BIN\BREVE.EXE DEMOS\GATHERERS.TZ

3) press space bar to toggle the simulation, <esc> to exit.  Use the left
   mouse button to select objects and to rotate the simulation, left  
   mouse button + shift to zoom the camera and the right mouse button to 
   access the simulation menu (or contextual menus associated with individual
   objects).  F1 steps forward the simulation a single step.

For more information about what the simulations do and how they work, open
up the demo files in any text editor and read the comments at the top of 
the file.

                               -= FEEDBACK =-

This software is provided with the hope that it will be useful--the only way 
for me to make the software more useful is to hear your feedback.  You can 
send me mail directly at jk [at] spiderland.org.  Please let me know how you 
use the software and how it could be improved. 

If you have any cool or useful simulations or classes that should be included 
with future releases, mail them as well.
