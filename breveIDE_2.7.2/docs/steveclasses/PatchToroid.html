<h3>Class description:</h3><p>
<blockquote>
 <a href="PatchToroid.html">PatchToroid</a> is a subclass of <a href="PatchGrid.html">PatchGrid</a> in which the patch neighbors are initialized in a toroidal fashion, such that patches on the edge of the grid are "connected" (via neighbor relationships) to patches on the opposite edge. <P> Note that since <a href="PatchGrid.html">PatchGrid</a> objects can already be 3 dimensional, that a 3D toroidal <a href="PatchGrid.html">PatchGrid</a> is actually not the traditional donut shaped toroidal topology--it's the corresponding topology in 4 dimensions.  Now I don't know about you, but I get a headache thinking about this stuff, so let's just agree that "toroid" is not the totally accurate term, but that it's the easiest way to describe what's going on here.</blockquote>
