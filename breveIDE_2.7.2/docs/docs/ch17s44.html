      Description for class <span class="bold"><strong>Patch</strong></span>:
    </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
      A patch is a non-physical object which is associated with a specific
      location in space. A patch can hold information about the state of the
      world in that location, such as the presence of a nutrient, for example.
      See the object PatchGrid for more information on setting up patches.
      Patches must be set up as part of a PatchGrid.
      </p><p>
        Because patches are not physical, they cannot move and they cannot
        collide with other objects. Though you can find the patch that an
        object is in, there is no collision callback when an object enters the
        patch. Patches can track the concentration of objects in their space.
        Currently this is limited to PatchChemical objects which are used to
        track information about abstract diffusable elements in the world. You
        can get the concentration, set the concentration, add and remove
        PatchChemcicals through the patch. See PatchGrid for adding
        PatchChemcials to the simulation and to iterate the diffusion. It is
        important to note that concentrations are stored in single precision
        floats currently to improve performance on hardware that supports SIMD
        processing.
      </p><p>
        The methods used to find neighboring patches depends on the type of
        simulation you're running. Though many of the "get-patch" methods
        described below behave the same as one another, they are named
        differently to be consistent with different types of simulations.
      </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>The neighbors are not fully initialized at the time that the init
        method is called.</strong></span> This is because the CLASS(PatchGrid) must create
        all of the patches before it can initialize the neighbors. Instead of
        accessing the neighbors in the init method, you should implement your
        own init-patch and place all initialization inside this method. The
        neighbors for the patch will be fully initialized by the time the
        init-patch method is called.
      </p><p>
        When using a 2D XY style simulation, use the following methods to get
        the four cardinal directions: get-patch-to-left, get-patch-to-right,
        get-patch-above and get-patch-below.
      </p><p>
        When using a 3D style simulation with and XZ ground plane (such that
        the vector (0, 1, 0) is pointing up, use the following methods to get
        the six cardinal directions: get-patch-to-north, get-patch-to-east,
        get-patch-to-south, get-patch-to-west, get-patch-above and
        get-patch-below.
      </p><p>
        These two groups of methods should suffice for most simulations, but if
        for some reason you use another orientation for your simulation which
        doesn't fit well with the vocabulary of these methods, you can use the
        following methods: get-patch-towards-plus-x, get-patch-towards-minus-x,
        get-patch-towards-plus-y, get-patch-towards-minus-y,
        get-patch-towards-plus-z and get-patch-towards-minus-z.
