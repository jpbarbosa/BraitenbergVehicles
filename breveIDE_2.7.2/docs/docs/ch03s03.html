        A number of changes introduced in breve 2.0 may require small changes
        to simulations written in previous versions of breve (1.x). These
        changes and instructions on upgrading simulations are discussed below.

        MultiBodies are now optional. Some MultiBody functionality has changed,
        and some MultiBody methods have been removed.
      </p><p>
        The MultiBody class is used to manage a logical collection of connected
        links. Prior to version 2.0, all physically connected objects were
        required to be part of a MultiBody. This lead to complications when
        multiple MultiBodies would merge to form a single body, or when a
        single MultiBody would split to become two bodies.
      </p><p>
        In version 2.0, MultiBody objects are now optional. The Link class is
        now a subclass of Mobile, so Links can be created as real objects in
        the simulated world, and can be connected or disconnected from other
        links as desired. The MultiBody object is now a distinct class. It can
        be used, if desired, to move or rotate a group of connected link
        objects, but it is otherwise not required for physically simulated
        bodies.
      </p><p>
        Some of the methods which MultiBody previously inherited from the Real
        class are now no longer available (since MultiBody is no longer a
        subclass of Real or Mobile). You must now call these methods directly
        on the link objects associated with the MultiBody. The method
        get-all-connected-links will help you
      </p><p>
        Freeing a MultiBody will also no longer free all of the connected Link
        and Joint objects, and the associated bodies will remain in the
        simulation. If you want to destroy the simulated objects, you should
        call the method free-all-connected-objects before freeing the
        MultiBody.
      </p><p>
        If your simulation made use of MultiBodies prior to version 2.0, you
        may need to modify your simulation to account for the changes described
        above.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="node-2611"></a>Arrays Are Now</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The use of arrays has now been deprecated and will be removed from a
        future release of breve: use lists instead
      </p><p>
        Lists have all of the functionality of arrays and more. Arrays existed
        for a short time before lists had been implemented, and have been
        around ever since, though they are only rarely used.
      </p><p>
        As of version 1.9, lists are indexed for fast access so that repeated
        list accesses are as fast as array accesses.
      </p><p>
        If your simulation uses arrays, you should convert them to lists to
        ensure compatibility in the future.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="node-2612"></a>The Data Class is Now Obsolete</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The Data class has been deprecated and will be removed from a future
        release of breve.
      </p><p>
        Because archiving and networking has been improved and allows for
        archiving of complex types such as objects and lists, the Data class is
        now obsolete. It will be removed from a future version of breve.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="node-2613"></a>The "Visions" class has been removed</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The same functionality can be reproduced using the new "Camera" class
        and the updated "Image" class.
      </p><p>
        The "Visions" class was used to provide the user with pixel buffers of
        rendered perspectives in the simulated world. This allowed multiple
        rendered perspectives in the main viewing window, but it also required
        reading pixels from the graphics card at each time step, an operation
        which is somewhat slow.
      </p><p>
        The new Camera class allows multiple perspectives to be rendered to the
        main output window without the slow pixel reading step. The updated
        Image class now allows pixels to be read from the main output window as
        desired. The Image class provides all of the functionality of the
        Vision class, and more: its pixels can be read or modified, it can be
        written to disk or used to texture another object in the simulation,
        and it can provide a pointer to raw pixel data.
      </p><p>
        One important note regarding differences between the Vision class and
        the Image class: Visions stored three separate pixel buffers for red,
        green, blue data. The Image class stores a single buffer containing
        interleaved red, green, blue and alpha pixels.
      </p><p>
        If your simulation used the Vision class in a prior version of breve,
        it will need to use the Camera and Image objects to preform the same
        functionality in the current version of breve.

        Obtaining a "texture number" by loading an image from the Control class
        is now deprecated, as is using a texture number to set a texture,
        bitmap or lightmap. You should now load an image using the Image class,
        and use the Real object methods set-texture-image, set-bitmap-image and
        set-lightmap-image to apply textures, bitmaps and images.
      </p><p>
        The Image class provides much better control over textures than the
        previous method.
