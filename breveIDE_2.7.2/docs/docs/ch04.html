      As of breve release 2.6, breve offers two choices of scripting languages
      for writing simulations:<a class="xref" href="ch04s03.html" title='Writing breve Simulations With "steve"'>the section called &#8220;Writing breve Simulations With "steve"&#8221;</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch04s02.html" title="Writing breve Simulations With Python">the section called &#8220;Writing breve Simulations With Python&#8221;</a>. Python support
      in breve is new, and is therefore not expected to be as robust as the
      "steve" frontend. However, in the long run, Python will be the
      recommended language frontend for all new breve development. The "steve"
      language is still supported, but will not have any new development.
    </p><p>
      For the time being, the following considerations may be useful when
      deciding which frontend language to use:

        This section discusses the conceptual structure of a breve simulation,
        which are <span class="emphasis"><em>common to both steve and Python language simulations</em></span>.
        Familiarize yourself with the concepts in this section before
        proceeding, regardless of which frontend language you intend to use.
      </p><p>
        breve is an agent based modelling environment in which the behaviors of
        agents are simulated at each time-step. In order to write a simulation
        in breve, you must define these agents in terms of how they behave and
        how they interact. These behaviors are updated at each time-step such
        that the agents are continuously reacting to their environment. In
        addition to behaviors at each time-step, behaviors can be specified to
        correspond to other events as well. The most notably of these other
        events is object initialization&#8212;each agent has a set of behaviors
        that are executed when the agent is created.
      </p><p>
        Writing simulations in breve is thus nothing more than specifying the
        behavior of agents&#8212;there is no code written that does not
        correspond to an agent. In order to specify agent behaviors, breve uses
        object-oriented languages, either the breve-specific steve language, or
        the popular (and externally developed) scripting language Python. In
        either case, you'll create an object type corresponding to each agent
        in the world, and you'll implement specific methods to specify the
        behaviors of these agents.
      </p><p>
        As mentioned above, the behavior of agents is specified based on
        certain events. The "init" event happens when the object is created,
        and the "iterate" event happens at each time-step. In terms of the
        object oriented language frontends, these behaviors are specified by
        creating methods called "init" and "iterate" for the agent classes.

            The program logic of a single agent.
          </p><p>
      The image above illustrates the program logic of a single agent. The
      agent is first initialized via its init method (__init__ in Python). Then
      at each time-step, the agent uses its iterate method to perform a series
      of tasks: obtain information about the world via sensors, perform
      computation on the information, and finally change its behavior or state
      based on the computed information. <span class="bold"><strong>The only way to make agents with
      custom behaviors is to subclass an existing agent class</strong></span>. breve
      includes built-in classes, such as Mobile and Stationary, which serve as
      agent templates for more sophisticated agent behaviors. To implement a
      more sophisticated agent behavior, create a subclass of one of breve's
      built-in classes and override the init and iterate methods to behave
      however you want them to.
