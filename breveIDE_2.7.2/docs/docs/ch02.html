        breve is a free environment designed for simulation of realistic, 3D,
        multi-agent systems.
      </p><p>
        This document describes breve and outlines how simulations are
        constructed. This chapter contains a brief overview on how to get
        started using breve to run simulations and how to get started on
        constructing your own.

        breve is a free simulation environment designed for multi-agent
        simulation. breve allows users to define the behaviors of autonomous
        agents in a continuous 3D world, then observe how they interact. breve
        includes support for a rich visualization engine, realistic physical
        simulation and an easy-to-use scripting language.
      </p><p>
        Starting in breve 2.6, breve simulations can be written in breve's
        custom <a class="xref" href="ch04s03.html" title='Writing breve Simulations With "steve"'>the section called &#8220;Writing breve Simulations With "steve"&#8221;</a> language, or with the popular
        open-source <a class="xref" href="ch04s02.html" title="Writing breve Simulations With Python">the section called &#8220;Writing breve Simulations With Python&#8221;</a> language. Both of these
        languages, along with their strengths and weaknesses are described
        later in this documentation.
      </p><p>
        breve can be used as a tool to explore any type of simulated world.
        breve has been used for a wide variety of simulation applications:
        simulated virtual creatures, artificial ecosystems, simulations of
        molecular biology, visualization and much more. breve facilitates the
        construction of complex agent-based simulations by automatically
        handling agent communication, representation in 3D space, graphical
        rendering, physical simulation and a number of other features which are
        useful to agent-based simulations.

        in particular, an object with autonomous behaviors which interacts with
        its environment and other agents. A <span class="emphasis"><em>multi-agent
        simulation</em></span> is a simulation in which multiple agents exist and
        interact in the simulated world. An example of a multi-agent simulation
        is an ecosystem simulation: a large number of autonomous agents
        (animals) interacting with each other (eating and breeding) and the
        environment.

            In the <span class="emphasis"><em>ParticleFountain</em></span>
            demo, you can see a particle system made up of hundreds of
            independent agents.
          </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="node-2618"></a>3D Spatial Simulation</h3></div></div></div><p> breve is a simulation
        environment which is used primarily for 3D <span class="emphasis"><em>spatial simulations</em></span>. This means that breve simulates
        3D physical space and that simulated agents occupy and interact in this
        physical space. Because of this, breve can be used for realistic
        simulations involving space, such as physical simulations. This is in
        contrast to simulation environments which model space in 2D or which
        treat "space" only as an abstract concept.
      </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../images/DLA.jpg" align="middle"></div><p>
            In the <span class="emphasis"><em>DLA</em></span> demo, a fractal
            structure forms in 3D space.
          </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="node-2619"></a>Physical Simulation</h3></div></div></div><p> breve is
        capable of realistic <span class="emphasis"><em>physical simulation</em></span>.
        This means that agents in the simulated world can be configured to
        behave just as real objects do, according to the laws of physics. If a
        ball is placed in the air above a floor, for example, physical
        simulation can be used to make the ball realistically fall toward the
        floor and bounce. Among other things, physical simulation can be used
        for realistic simulation of robots, vehicles and animals.

            In the <span class="emphasis"><em>Walker</em></span> demo, a
            physically simulated creature learns to walk.
