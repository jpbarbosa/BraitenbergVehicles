        simulated agents to behave in a physically realistic fashion. This
        means that agents in the simulated world can be configured to behave
        just as real objects do, according to the laws of physics. If a ball is
        placed in the air above a floor, for example, physical simulation can
        be used to make the ball realistically fall toward the floor and
        bounce. Among other things, physical simulation can be used for
        realistic simulation of robots, vehicles and animals. The current
        version of breve uses portions of the excellent ODE physical simulation
        engine.
      </p><p>
        Even though it is incredibly useful, physical simulation can add
        complexity and potential instabilities to a simulation. This chapter
        begins with the section When to Use Physical Simulation (<a class="xref" href="ch08.html#node-2727" title="When to Use Physical Simulation">the section called &#8220;When to Use Physical Simulation&#8221;</a>), which
        discusses when it is appropriate to use physical simulation and
        possible alternatives to full physical simulation. You should read this
        section first to help you decide whether physical simulation is
        necessary for your simulation.

        circumstances, users wish to write simulations that use certain aspects
        of physics, but not others. In these situations it is tempting to
        enable physical simulation, but this often opens the door to other
        sorts of complications. Physical simulation is slower, more complicated
        and inherently less stable than non-physical simulation. It is often
        far more effective to use "pseudo-physics" in which you implement some
        physical simulation features without enabling full physical simulation.
      </p><p>
        One example is a simulation which requires gravity for "ballistic"
        (non-Multibody Real) objects. Though the effects of gravity can be
        enabled using physical simulation, a more robust and far more efficient
        approach is to simply set a constant acceleration of (0, -9.8, 0). By
        disabling the physical simulation engine and setting a constant
        acceleration, a great deal of complexity can be avoided.
      </p><p>
        Another example is two objects that stick together and behave as a
        single entity. Though this can be simulated as a <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/MultiBody.html" target="_top">MultiBody</a> object, if other aspects of physical
        simulation are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> required, it
        may be better to enforce the relationship between the objects manually
        at each time-step by making one of the objects move itself to maintain
        a certain position relative to the other.
      </p><p>
        It's often unclear which technique should be used, but many users tend
        to err on the side of enabling physics which is the <span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> complicated solution. True physical
        simulation is typically necessary only when dealing with physically
        realistic jointed bodies, such as a simulated robot or simulated
        animal. You should be aware of the pros and cons of true physical
        simulation and consider using your own "pseudo-physics" instead.
