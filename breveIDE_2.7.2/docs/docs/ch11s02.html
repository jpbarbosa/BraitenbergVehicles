        objects or subsets of objects in a simulation. When an object is
        dearchived with this technique, a new instance is created for the saved
        object and loaded into a running simulation. This approach is in
        contrast to the method described in Saving and Loading the Entire State
        of a Simulation <a class="xref" href="ch11s03.html" title="Saving and Loading the Entire State of a Simulation">the section called &#8220;Saving and Loading the Entire State of a Simulation&#8221;</a>,
        which creates an entirely new simulation from an archived world. The
        steps described here also apply to sending and receiving objects over a
        network, as described in Sending and Receiving breve Objects <a class="xref" href="ch12s02.html" title="Sending and Receiving breve Objects">the section called &#8220;Sending and Receiving breve Objects&#8221;</a>.

        In a "simple" object archive, only a single object is encoded. If the
        object has <code class="literal">object</code> variables or
        <code class="literal">pointer</code> variables, they will be set to 0
        when the object is dearchived. All other variable types will be
        restored to their pre-archived values. For simple object archiving and
        dearchiving, no additional code or preparation is required.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="node-2751"></a>Saving and Loading Objects With Dependencies</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Variables of type <code class="literal">object</code> and <code class="literal">pointer</code> cannot be automatically maintained without
        special treatment. This is because an <code class="literal">object</code> may reference another, which in turn
        references several others, and so forth. If all <code class="literal">object</code> variables were maintained, then a huge chain
        reaction would result every time an instance was saved.
      </p><p>
        To avoid this, saving objects does not include an object variable
        <span class="emphasis"><em>unless</em></span> the the object being
        saved has declared it as a dependency, using the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Object.html" target="_top">Object</a> method <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Object.html#add-dependency" target="_top">add-dependency</a>. If you define an object, Y, as a
        dependency of X, then saving X will also save Y. Loading the saved
        instance X will also recreate the instance Y.
      </p><p>
        Because adding dependencies also has the potential to lead to
        chain-reactions of archiving, it should be used with care. Generally,
        an object should only add dependencies on objects it has created and
        for which it is exclusively responsible. So while a simulated creature
        might legitimately add a dependency on an object containing its genome
        or an object which determines its movement (a "brain"), it would be
        inappropriate for the object to add a dependency on the controller
        object, or other creatures in the world.
      </p><p>
        When an object is to be archived using this technique, the
        user-supplied method <code class="literal">archive</code> is executed
        for the object. In your <code class="literal">archive</code> method,
        you should include code that might be needed to prepare the object for
        archiving such as updating variables which will be required when the
        object is dearchived. <span class="emphasis"><em>Your <code class="function">archive</code> method must, on success, return
        1</em></span>. Any other return value is considered failure and will
        abort the archive.
      </p><p>
        When an object is to be dearchived using this method, the user-supplied
        method <code class="literal">dearchive</code> is executed for the
        object. In your <code class="literal">dearchive</code> method, you
        should include code that might be needed to restore the state of the
        object, or to inform the rest of the simulation of its presence if
        necessary. <span class="emphasis"><em>Your dearchive method must, on
        success, return 1</em></span>. Any other return value is considered
        failure and will abort the archive.
      </p><p>
        Once dependencies, archive methods and dearchive methods (all of which
        may prove to be unnecessary for most straightforward classes) are
        addressed, you may initiate an archive using the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Object.html" target="_top">Object</a> method <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Object.html#archive-as-xml" target="_top">archive-as-xml</a>.
      </p><p>
        To dearchive an object previously archived with this technique, use the
        <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Control.html" target="_top">Control</a> method <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Control.html#dearchive-xml" target="_top">dearchive-xml</a>. Note that this creates new instances
        of the objects in the archived file, instead of "filling" an existing
        object.
