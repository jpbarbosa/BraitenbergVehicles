        This chapter describes genetic programming, and describes how to use
        genetic programming in breve simulations using an evolvable language
        called "Push".
      </p><p>
        Many artificial life simulations are designed around the concept of
        evolving agents: agents in a simulated world use evolution in order to
        find better and better solutions to some task such as locomotion,
        survival or some sort of "intelligent" behavior.
      </p><p>
        Evolution of agent behaviors is typically accomplished in one of two
        ways: optimizing a set of parameters, a technique known as "genetic
        algorithms" (GA); or by developing evolved computer programs, a
        technique known as "genetic programming".
      </p><p>
        Genetic programming involves random crossover and mutation of computer
        programs. Most computer languages designed for people are picky about
        syntax and variable types and are not well suited to
        evolution&#8212;most random crossovers and mutations would produce code
        that simply does not compile (like <code class="literal">x = y +
        =;</code>), or code that does compile, but does not make sense
        semantically (like <code class="literal">x = sqrt( "puppydog"
        );</code>).
      </p><p>
        The "Push" language is designed specifically for genetic programming
        and other evolutionary computational applications. Push is designed to
        avoid most of the complications that can arise when evolving code. In
        fact, Push code is almost never written by hand. This chapter is
        intended as a short introduction to using Push in breve simulations and
        is not a definitive overview of Push or its features. More information
        about Push and how it is being used can be found on <a class="ulink" href="http://hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html" target="_top">this page</a>.
      </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="node-2760"></a>A Brief Introduction to Push</h2></div></div></div><p>
        The Push language is well suited for evolution because of its extremely
        simple syntax, and its stack-based typing system. The simple syntax
        helps to ensure that any kind of genetic operator (including the
        commonly used crossover and mutation) will produce a syntactically
        valid individual. The stack-based typing system&#8212;in which
        instructions look for operators on typed stacks&#8212;ensures that all
        push programs are semantically valid.
      </p><p>
        Arguments are passed to instructions using a set of stacks, one for
        each variable type. When an instruction is executed, it reads and
        removes argument values from the tops of the relevant stacks, it
        performs a computation, and then it pushes any output values onto the
        relevant stacks. If a stack is empty and cannot provide input values
        for an instruction, the instruction performs a "NOOP" and does nothing.
        This scheme ensures that instructions are always provided with input
        data of the correct type.
      </p><p>
        The version of push built into breve 2.0 provides support for the
        following native types: integer, float, name, vector and code.
      </p><p>
        A Push program is made up of lists of the following elements:
        instructions, literal values, and sublists of these elements. Execution
        of a Push program begins by placing the entire expression onto the code
        stack and proceeds recursively as follows:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
        To execute program P:
                If P is a single instruction then execute it.
                Else if P is a literal then push it onto the appropriate stack.
                Else (P must be a list) sequentially execute each of the Push programs in P.
</pre><p>
        Here's a sample Push program which does some mathematical and logical
        computations:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
( 2 3 INTEGER.* 4.1 5.2 FLOAT.+ TRUE FALSE BOOLEAN.OR )
</pre><p>
        After execution of the program, the stacks are left in the following
        states:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
        # the program we started with
        CODE STACK: ( ( 2 3 INTEGER.* 4.1 5.2 FLOAT.+ TRUE FALSE BOOLEAN.OR ) )

        # the result of the code TRUE FALSE BOOLEAN.OR
        BOOLEAN STACK: ( TRUE )

        # the result of the code 4.1 5.2 FLOAT.+
        FLOAT STACK: ( 9.3 )

        # the result of the code 2 3 INTEGER.*
        INTEGER STACK: ( 6 )
</pre><p>
        Real push programs are far more complex: instructions are provided to
        allow push programs to modify their own code, perform logical and
        program flow control operations. and even create and run new programs
        on-the-fly (automatically providing support for elements which resemble
        macros and "automatically defined functions"). For a full list of Push
        instructions and features, see <a class="ulink" href="http://hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html" target="_top">this page</a>.
