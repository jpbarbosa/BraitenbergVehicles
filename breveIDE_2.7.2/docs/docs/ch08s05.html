              Changed in breve 2.0
            </h3><p>
                The methods used for loading images have been changed from
                breve 1.x, so pay close attention to this section if you're
                updating your simulation from a previous version of breve.
              </p></div><p>
        In order to construct physically simulated agents, you'll need to be
        familiar with the components of physically simulated bodies. There are
        three main components used in physical simulations:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
              Links, the basic building blocks of physically simulated objects
            </p></li><li><p>
              MultiBodies, physical bodies made up of one or more Link objects
              (<a class="xref" href="ch08s05.html#node-2734" title="The MultiBody class">the section called &#8220;The MultiBody class&#8221;</a>)
            </p></li><li><p>
              Joints, rigid connections between Link objects (<a class="xref" href="ch08s05.html#node-2733" title="The Joint Class and its Subclasses">the section called &#8220;The Joint Class and its Subclasses&#8221;</a>)
            </p></li><li><p>
              Springs, flexible connections between Link objects (<a class="xref" href="ch08s07.html" title="Using Springs">the section called &#8220;Using Springs&#8221;</a>)
            </p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="node-2732"></a>The Link Class</h3></div></div></div><p> The Link class is the
        basic building block of physically simulated objects. A link is simply
        a rigid body with a particular shape. Once a Link is created and
        associated with a shape, it can be attached to other links via Joint
        objects, covered in the section The Joint Class and its Subclasses
        (<a class="xref" href="ch08s05.html#node-2733" title="The Joint Class and its Subclasses">the section called &#8220;The Joint Class and its Subclasses&#8221;</a>) or brought
        into the physical simulation by being associated with a MultiBody, as
        discussed in the section on using MultiBody objects (<a class="xref" href="ch08s05.html#node-2734" title="The MultiBody class">the section called &#8220;The MultiBody class&#8221;</a>).
      </p><p>
        Prior to breve 2.0, Link objects would not appear in the simulated
        world unless they were associated with MultiBody objects (described
        below). This is no longer the case.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="node-2733"></a>The Joint Class and its Subclasses</h3></div></div></div><p> As mentioned in the previous section (<a class="xref" href="ch08s05.html#node-2734" title="The MultiBody class">the section called &#8220;The MultiBody class&#8221;</a>), <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Link.html" target="_top">Links</a> are joined together using <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Joint.html" target="_top">Joint</a> objects.
      </p><p>
        There are several types of joints available&#8212;see each class'
        documentation for more details:

        is a single logical physically simulated agent, whether it is made up
        of a single Link, or multiple Links joined together with Joint objects.
      </p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The role of the MultiBody has changed
        drastically in breve 2.0 from previous versions of breve</em></span>.
        Previously, Link objects would not appear at all in the simulated world
        unless they were part of a MultiBody. Now, the use of MultiBodies is
        completely optional.
      </p><p>
        Keeping a set of Links bound together as a logical MultiBody unit
        allows the user to move or rotate the entire logical structure, as
        opposed to moving or rotating individual links. Imagine that suddenly
        your arm was moved across the room without the rest of your body
        &#8212;in all likelihood, this would not make you very happy. This is
        what it's like for the underlying physics engine to move a single
        link&#8212;confusing and painful things can happen. By encompassing a
        set of connected Links within a MultiBody, the user has more logical
        control over the object.
      </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../images/MultiBody.jpg" align="middle"></div><p>
        To create a MultiBody, you can simply associate it with any existing
        Link object. The Link object you choose will be known as the <span class="emphasis"><em>root link</em></span>, and all other Links connected to the root
        link&#8212;directly or indirectly&#8212;will become part of the
        MultiBody. The MultiBody is automatically updated as joints are created
        and destroyed.
