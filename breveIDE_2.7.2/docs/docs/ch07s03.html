        objects is to look at every object in the simulation and determine
        whether they are close enough to be considered neighbors. To repeat
        this process for N objects that we want to keep track of, N*N checks
        are required for each iteration. This quickly becomes an inefficient
        bottleneck.
      </p><p>
        breve offers a solution to this problem in which the time required to
        find neighbors grows roughly linearly with the number of the objects in
        the simulation. The feature is referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>neighbor checking</em></span>. Neighbor checking is done in three
        steps:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              Set each agent's "neighborhood size".
            </p></li><li><p>
              Ask the engine to update the neighbors at each iteration.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Retrieve each agents list of neighbors at each timestep.
            </p></li></ol></div><p>
        The neighborhood size specifies the distance that each agent will look
        in order to find any neighbors. The distance between two objects is, in
        this case, defined as the distance between the center-points of the
        objects. Setting the neighborhood size is typically done during object
        initialization, but it may be changed at any time during the
        simulation. Neighborhood size is set using the method <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Real.html#set-neighborhood-size" target="_top">set-neighborhood-size</a> in <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Real.html" target="_top">Real.tz</a>. Real is the parent class of both <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Stationary.html" target="_top">Stationary</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Mobile.html" target="_top">Mobile</a> objects, so the method can be used with these classes
        as well.
      </p><p>
        The second step, updating the neighbors, is done with a call to the
        method <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Control.html" target="_top">update-neighbors</a> in the iterate method of your simulation's
        controller object.
      </p><p>
        The final step of retrieving the neighbors is done using the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Real.html#get-neighbors" target="_top">get-neighbors</a> method of <a class="ulink" href="http://www.spiderland.org/documentation/classes/Real.html" target="_top">Real.tz</a>. This method returns the neighbors as a <code class="literal">list</code>. For example, the following iterate method would
        print out a list of the agent's neighbors at each time step, assuming
        that the neighborhood size has been set and that the neighbors are
        being updated:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
+ to iterate:
        neighbors (list).
        item (object).

        neighbors = (self get-neighbors).

        foreach item in neighbors: print "$item is in my neighborhood.".
